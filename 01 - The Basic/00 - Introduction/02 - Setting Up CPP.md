For programming in C++ we must follow an few steps.

1- Installing an Compiler

C++ is an compiled language, that means that when you execute it, before seeing it, the machine will execute the program and then display it on the screen.
For a example we can use this compilers:
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for Linux and macOS
- MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) for Windows
- Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows
For the full tutorial you can go to [03 - Installing an Compiler]()

2- Installing an IDE

The IDE or Integrated Development Environment is a software that facilitates our development in any programming language.\
For a example we can use this editors:
- Visual Studio / VSC (Windows, macOS)
- Eclipse (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Code::Blocks (Windows, macOS, Linux)

3- Start Programming in C++
